# Augmented Reality (AR) Pop-Up Book for Inclusive Education

## Introduction
This project aims to leverage Augmented Reality (AR) technology to enhance inclusive education for children with diverse abilities. Inclusive education is considered a fundamental right, and AR presents a promising solution to cater to the unique learning needs of these children. By providing multi-modal content and interactive experiences, AR facilitates improved access and comprehension of educational materials.

## Objectives
- Develop a 3D pop-up book using Augmented Reality(AR) to enhance education for children with disabilities.
- Promote engagement, motivation, and accessibility through interactive and enjoyable learning experiences.

## Scope
Our project aims to enable immersive learning for students through Augmented Reality(AR), with a particular focus on transforming 2D book images into 3D objects.

## Advantages
- Personalised Learning Experience
- Multi-Sensory Engagement
- Collaborative Learning and Social Skills Development

## Applications
- **Social Skills Training**: Enhance social skills in a safe and visually engaging environment.
- **Sensory Integration**: Promote sensory development and awareness through multisensory experiences.
- **Cultural Awareness and Diversity**: Foster inclusivity and appreciation for diversity.
- **Emotional Regulation and Expression**: Aid emotional intelligence development through interactive activities.

## Methodology
The project involves creating a 3D pop-up book using Unity software, incorporating assets from Adobe Illustrator, Vuforia, and Unity. The process follows a linear, sequential model that emphasizes accessibility considerations for developers. Conceptualization and storyboarding are integral parts of the methodology, ensuring that prototypes or materials are tailored to the specific characteristics and needs of children with disabilities.

## Literature Review
### A Systematic Review of the Use of Augmented Reality Technology for Individuals with Special Needs
- **Advantages**: Interactive and engaging learning experiences, real-time feedback and reinforcement.
- **Disadvantages**: Prohibitive cost, complexity of technology usage.

### Enhancing Joint Attention Skills in Children on the Autism Spectrum through an Augmented Reality Technology-Mediated Intervention
- **Advantage**: Significant and lasting improvements in RJA skills post-intervention, sustained over time and applicable to real-world situations.
- **Disadvantage**: Limited by small sample size and a single setting.

### AReal-Vocab: An Augmented Reality English Vocabulary Mobile Application to Cater to Mild Autism Children in Response towards Sustainable Education for Children with Disabilities
- **Advantages**: Improved vocabulary learning in treatment group versus control, highlighting the need for larger-scale validation studies due to small sample size.

## Conclusion
Augmented Reality stands as a transformative tool, promising a more inclusive and supportive learning environment for children with disabilities.
